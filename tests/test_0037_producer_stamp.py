"""specs/0037 v23 / specs/0006 v10 — the store boundary STATED, `Provenance`
FROZEN, and the PRODUCER stamp (the owner's word, dev session 2026-09-14:
"Confirm as relayed", on research's recommendation ruled 02:06Z).

Three facts this file binds, each with the mutant the reviewer would try:

1. `Provenance` is frozen: no ordinary assignment changes a built stamp, so
   the attribute-chain route V-TWO-PRODUCERS' sweep could not see
   (`prov.record_kind = "procedural"` on an already-built model) no longer
   exists — the sweep's grammar is now the WHOLE grammar (V-PROVENANCE-FROZEN).
2. Every procedural record written by this version carries WHICH product path
   minted it — `producer="host"` from `record_procedure`, `"extractor"` from
   the quote-gated capture — a write-time fact absorption never touches,
   immutable on same-id replace, inherited across a supersession, absent on
   every declarative record (bytes unchanged) and on procedural records from
   before the stamp (V-PRODUCER-STAMPED / -IMMUTABLE / -INHERITED).
3. The doctor's procedural tripwire no longer merges the two populations it
   exists to separate: declared, captured and unstamped are three numbers,
   never added (research's finding, 2026-09-14).

The boundary statement itself (`Store.add_edge` is an interface a host
IMPLEMENTS, not a write API it CALLS; a record written through it carries what
the caller minted) is a carrier check here — the sentence must stand in
0006, 0037 and the host documentation — and a stated limit, not a gate.

    (`host`, no predecessor) and Q (`extractor`); the file carries a copy of P
    CLAIMING Q as its predecessor (refused) and S (`extractor`, supersedes P). S
    restored, because the lineage helper preserved P's stored producer and then
    replaced it with the producer derived from the claimed chain. Now a
    persisted producer IS the constraint: a claimed ancestry — from an admitted
    or a refused copy — can add procedural-ness and never replace it. Q stored
    or arriving in the file, both orders; the control without the copy; the
    mutants: an agreeing claim lets a `host` successor restore, and an
    UNSTAMPED stored predecessor takes the claimed chain's producer (a claim can
