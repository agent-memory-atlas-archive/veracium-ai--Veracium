"""0040 §2's carrier enumeration — DERIVED, never hand-maintained.

A hand-listed carrier set is what lost `edges.subject`: §2 named the `object`
column as "the second site" and INV-2 planted one mutant, while the DDL carries
THREE columns duplicating json fields. Dev found `subject`; re-deriving found
`relation` too.

🔴 AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS SCRIPT REPRODUCED THE SAME DEFECT. It parsed
the DDL with a line-anchored regex (`^\\s*(\\w+)\\s+(TEXT|INTEGER)`), which found
`id` and `object` — the two columns that happen to start a line — and MISSED
`subject` and `relation`, which sit mid-line. An enumeration is only as complete
as its parser, and a regex over source text is a parser nobody reviewed. It now
splits on commas inside the parens.

🔴 AND THE THIRD FAILURE, found 2026-09-13 when dev announced a v14 receipt
table: THIS SCRIPT READ `SCHEMA_V1` AND SWEPT ONE TABLE. The current schema is
`SCHEMA_V13` with FOURTEEN tables — `edge_event`, `edge_embedding`,
`contribution_ledger`, `confirmations`, `source_revocations`, `store_epoch` and
the rest were invisible to it, including three that 0040 §2's own carrier table
already names. The tool built to stop a hand-list missing things was reading a
schema twelve versions stale, and it LOOKED FINE because its output for `edges`
was correct. A derivation is only as wide as its corpus.

It now discovers the latest `SCHEMA_Vn` by version number and sweeps EVERY
table, so a new table (the v14 receipt) appears without anyone remembering to
add it.

🔴 AND THE FOURTH FAILURE, found by the 0041 round-1 reviewer (2026-09-15):
SECTION B'S MODEL SET WAS ITSELF A HAND-LIST. It read `text_fields(Edge)` and
`text_fields(Provenance)` — two model names written literally — so it never
looked at `Episode` (missing `retired_reason`) and never recursed into nested
models (missing `agreement.markers` under a foreign lexicon version). The same
defect as `SCHEMA_V1`, one source lower: a derivation whose CORPUS is named by
hand. It now discovers every `BaseModel` in `veracium.schema` and RECURSES
through nested model fields, so a new model or a new nested shape appears
without anyone remembering it.

TWO SOURCES, because neither sees what the other does:
  A. the DDL          — columns, ALL TABLES. Cannot see inside the `json` blob.
  B. the pydantic models — every field that can hold text, including the ones
                           that live inside `json` and are invisible to SQL.

# C. TRIAGE — carrier or not, DERIVED. 125 paths are not 125 carriers.
#
# Section B counts PATHS. A path is not an identity: ContestedGroup.exposed.*
# and SupersessionPlan.incoming_edge.* are both `Edge`, reached through a
# container, and redacting Edge.note redacts it everywhere it is reachable.
# Pasting 125 rows into the spec would inventory the same field up to three
# times and call the repetition coverage.
#
# Three inputs, each derived, none declared:
#   1. TERMINAL identity   -- collapse every path to (owning model, field).
#   2. PERSISTED           -- a model is directly persisted iff the store
#                             layer reconstructs it with model_validate_json;
#                             you only validate from JSON what you wrote as
#                             JSON. Nested models inherit it by containment.
#   3. BOUNDED             -- the value space is closed (Literal / pattern /
#                             enum), so no user text can reach the field.
#
# NOTE ON max_length, WHICH IS THE TRAP HERE: Provenance.source_id carries
# max_length=512. That bounds the LENGTH and not the VALUE SPACE -- 512
# characters of free text is still free text. Counting max_length as a bound
# would mark a genuine carrier clean, so it is deliberately NOT a bound below.
