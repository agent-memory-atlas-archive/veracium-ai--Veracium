"""Portable memory export/import — the no-lock-in guarantee, as a file format.

One JSONL file per user: a header line, then one record per line carrying the
FULL unit — provenance, disclosure, validity windows, supersession links,
invalidation reasons. Nothing is summarized or dropped: an import into a fresh
store reproduces the memory exactly, superseded history and quarantined claims
included. The wiki cache is deliberately not exported — it is a derived view
and recompiles from the store of record.

    {"kind": "veracium-export", "version": 2, "user_id": "...", "exported_at": "..."}
    {"record": "edge", ...Edge fields...}
    {"record": "episode", ...Episode fields...}
    {"record": "redaction", ...the attestation record + its source identity (format 13, specs/0041)...}

Format v2 renamed the per-line type marker from "kind" to "record" because
Episode gained its own `kind` field (outcome tracking); v1 files import
unchanged.

Import is idempotent: records whose id already exists in the target store are
skipped, never overwritten. `user_id=` remaps the import into a different user.

Trust note (specs/0005): provenance in an export file is *data*, and the
sentence "importing a file grants its records whatever authorship and
disclosure they claim" is true ONLY under `restore=True` — the operator's
explicit assertion that the file is this store's own history. The DEFAULT
import caps every record's trust instead: `author_of_evidence` and
`derived_from` are set to `THIRD_PARTY` and `disclosure` is floored to
`USE_ONLY` (`QUARANTINED` is never weakened), so nothing imported is
assertable or grounded as the target user's own testimony, regardless of what
the file claims, omits, or sets its header to.
