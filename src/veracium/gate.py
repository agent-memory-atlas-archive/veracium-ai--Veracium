"""The evidence-grounded abstention gate (finding 23 — the piece the research
specified but never built).

Two failures in the research shared one root cause: the winning architecture
almost never abstained when it lacked an answer (D: 94% confabulation on wrong
answers), and the one injection leak that survived structural quarantine came in
through a third-party *episode* (C). Both are the same problem — asserting things
whose only support is unverified. The gate is the fix: partition memory into
GROUNDED (verified, assertable) and UNVERIFIED (third-party claims/reports), then
require the answer to come from grounded memory, abstain when it doesn't, and
never assert unverified material as fact.

This is a read-time discipline over veracium's structural provenance separation —
no extra classifier call, just the answer call the host would make anyway.

    decision table, §4b's rail.)

    `decision` is the `(visible, shape)` pair from
    `scope.DECISION_TABLE` — the FIXED table, consumed, never re-derived.

    **RESTRICT-ONLY, and that is the whole contract.** This function is a
    conjunction of restrictions over `record_assertable`: it can turn True
    into False and never False into True. No scope status raises trust, and
    none of `ungrounded` / `needs_confirmation` / `disclosure` is ever
    cleared or lifted here — same-scope (OWN) yields *exactly today's*
    answer, and `test_same_scope_grants_nothing` enumerates the tempting
    cells (the own-inference re-assertability cell by name). Any grant wants
    a 0006 amendment, not this predicate.

    The cells:

    - invisible (`CROSS_HIDDEN` / `UNRESOLVED`) → never assertable (it is
      not even on the response surface);
    - `third-party-shaped` (`CROSS_VISIBLE`) → visible, NEVER assertable —
      v1 pins cross-scope material to the third-party-testimony shape;
    - `own` / `shared` → today's gate verdict, unchanged.

    **THE 0011 SEAM (0020 V9, §7b — reserved, inert in v1).**
    `subject_entitlement` is the named parameter spec 0011 (subject-scoped
    entitlement) will drive. It is ORTHOGONAL to the principal dimension and
    carries no behaviour in v1: `None` means "0011 has not ruled", and the
    only value that can ever act is `False`, which RESTRICTS. The seam may
    never be widened into a grant — a True entitlement is still just "0011
    does not object" and returns today's answer.
    `test_gate_seam_reserved_for_0011` fails if the parameter disappears or
